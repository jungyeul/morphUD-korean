# An alternative format of morpheme-based Universal Dependencies (morphUD) for Korean

- src: a script folder
- morphUD/UD_Korean-GSD|UD_Korean-Kaist: a morphUD folder and their parsing results 
- morphUD_alt/UD_Korean-GSD|UD_Korean-Kaist: a morphUD's alternative annotation (for uuparser) and their parsing results
- wordUD: the original Korean UD's parsing results

morphUD and morphUD_alt folders contain their parsing results in the form of wordUD (for comparison) and morphUD (as they are for future reference).
