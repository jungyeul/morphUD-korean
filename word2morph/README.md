# The Word2Morph script

The Word2Morph script converts word-based UD files into the morpheme-based format. 

Please run the main script from the directory the original UD files are placed. Morpheme-based files will be generated by following the prompts. 

Please kindly ignore the messages during the conversion - these are for debug only.
